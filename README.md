# Bitcoin-Predictions-Project-
Using-Bitcoin-Pricing-Data-to-Create-a-Profitable-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-Project
In this project, we created an algorithm that would predict the price of bitcoin in x minutes relative to the current price, where x âˆˆ {5, 10, 20}. Our investment strategy would then be to repeatedly invest for x minutes if the algorithm stated that the price increased, and do nothing otherwise. We modeled this problem as a classification problem, where the two categories were based on whether the price increased or decreased
